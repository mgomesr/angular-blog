            During the Armageddon war, all warriors from the realms have been killed, leaving only Raiden and Shao Kahn remaining. Having defeated 
            Blaze, Shao Khan is imbued with godlike power and easily overpowers Raiden. In a final attempt to stop Shao Kahn, Raiden casts one 
            last spell to send a message to his past self through his shattered amulet, with the vague message "He must win" before Shao Kahn 
            delivers a killing blow on him.

            During the events of the first tournament from the first game, the past Raiden sees visions of the future due to the message he 
            received and notices his amulet has been damaged. Raiden concludes that Liu Kang must win the tournament to save Earthrealm. 
            During the tournament, Liu Kang becomes the only remaining Earthrealm contender, due in part to Scorpion's murder of Bi-Han, 
            better known as Sub-Zero, in retaliation for the latter's massacre of the former's Shirai Ryu clan including Scorpion's wife and 
            infant son some years earlier. Raiden pleads with Scorpion to spare Sub-Zero in exchange for asking the Elder Gods to resurrect 
            Scorpion’s clan. Scorpion reluctantly agrees, but Quan Chi produces false visions in Scorpion’s mind, enraging him and causing him to 
            slay Sub-Zero as he did in the original timeline. Liu Kang is successful in defeating the Shokan Prince Goro, as well as the crafty 
            sorcerer Shang Tsung. Raiden's amulet, however, cracks further, a sign that future events remain unchanged. Disappointed with the 
            sorcerer's failure, emperor Shao Kahn orders Shang Tsung's execution, but is convinced otherwise when the sorcerer suggests holding 
            a second tournament in Outworld with different stakes: if Earthrealm wins, Outworld will leave them alone forever, but if Outworld 
            wins, they will be allowed to invade Earthrealm uninhibited. Though he initially refuses, Raiden relents when Tarkatans invade 
            Earthrealm as part of Shang Tsung's blackmail against Earthrealm.
        
            During the second tournament, Bi-Han's younger brother Kuai Liang decides to become the new Sub-Zero, and he and his friend Smoke 
            arrive to avenge his brother. They are followed by Lin Kuei cyber assassins Sektor and Cyrax who are tasked with retrieving the rogue 
            warriors for cybernetic conversion. Raiden changes the timeline by rescuing Smoke from being converted, at the cost of Kuai Liang 
            being taken away. Kitana, the adopted daughter of Shao Kahn, chooses to join Earthrealm's fight after learning of the existence 
            of her half-Tarkatan clone Mileena, created by Shang Tsung on Shao Kahn's orders, with Kitana's childhood friend Jade, joining her 
            later. In a bid to save Earth, Raiden substitutes Kung Lao in place of Liu Kang during the tournament. Following his victory over 
            Shang Tsung, the ruler of Netherrealm, Quan Chi, and the fire-breathing Kintaro, Kung Lao's neck is snapped by Shao Kahn while his 
            back was turned, killing him, with Liu Kang retaliating and mortally wounding the emperor in a fit of rage. Raiden's amulet 
            continues to deteriorate and he becomes increasingly concerned.

            Skyrim is set 200 years after the events of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, although it is not a direct sequel. Skyrim is a cold 
            and mountainous region in the north of the continent of Tamriel. It has traditionally been divided into nine administrative 
            sections, called "holds", each governed by a jarl from a larger town. Of these settlements, five—Solitude, Windhelm, Markarth, 
            Riften, and Whiterun—are larger and more powerful. The landscape is littered with forts, camps, and ruins, some of which were built 
            by the now-extinct race of the Dwemer, or Deep Elves. The Nords, one of the human races, view Skyrim as their homeland, though 
            members of other races populate Skyrim as well.

            Skyrim is a province of the much larger Empire, which comprises most of Tamriel. The Empire has recently fought a war with the 
            elvish Aldmeri Dominion, who believe that they are racially superior to humans. While the conflict, known as the Great War, ended 
            in a military stalemate after a hard-fought battle at the imperial capital, the greatly weakened Empire was forced to sign a 
            humiliating peace treaty called the White-Gold Concordat.
        
            While most of Tamriel worship a religious pantheon of eight deities, the Nords of Skyrim are accustomed to worshiping a ninth god, 
            Talos, the deified Nord general who founded the Empire. The Dominion, led by the intolerant Thalmor sect, rejects this notion and 
            its implication that a man became greater than any elf. They instituted a clause in the Concordat forbidding Talos worship in the 
            Empire. Motivated in part by this condition, Ulfric Stormcloak, the jarl of Windhelm, leads a rebellion against imperial rule, 
            with the holds divided roughly evenly between the two sides.
        
            In the ancient past, dragons ruled over vast swaths of Tamriel. Their hegemony was overthrown when three human warriors threw the 
            dragon ruler, Alduin, forward in time using an Elder Scroll, a powerful and mysterious artifact. When Skyrim begins, the survival 
            of the last dragon, the sage Paarthurnax, is a secret kept by an order of monks called the Greybeards. Within their monastery atop 
            the Throat of the World, Skyrim's highest mountain, the Greybeards dedicate their lives to the Way of the Voice, a discipline for 
            powerful draconic spells called "shouts". Rare warriors are "Dragonborn", having the ability to learn shouts intuitively by 
            absorbing the souls of dead dragons. Ancient prophecy maintains that Alduin will return to consume the world, and a "Last 
            Dragonborn" will defeat him.

            Level designer Mark Thompson stated that in a Far Cry game, morality was not absolute and that there was always "a moral gray space". 
            The team intentionally avoided introducing a morality system which would judge players' actions. Gray morality is seen as Jason 
            murdered the pirates in order to rescue his friends and survive on the hostile island. The team took inspiration from Apocalypse Now, 
            The Deer Hunter, and Deliverance when they were writing the story. They understood the game as a first-person shooter, which involves 
            killing many non-playable characters to succeed, and the team wanted a story that embraced the concept of shooting to prevent 
            narrative dissonance that might hinder the story and the overall experience. As Jason kills more people, he becomes increasingly 
            tolerant toward violence. Hay stated that players will slowly see the transformation in Jason, as he strays further from who he was 
            at the beginning of the game, and begins to parallel his pirate counterparts. Jason's hallucination sequences were meant to 
            reflect his destabilizing psyche. Thompson described them as "introspective sequences" in which Jason's conscience questions the 
            players' actions. When he was writing these sequences, Jeffrey Yohalem was inspired by the dreamlike levels from Prince of Persia. 
            Jason's friends view him differently and he will begin experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder. Despite his explanatory closing 
            narrative, the game left room for interpretation. Ultimately, Hay stated that the story was about the cost of becoming a hero, and 
            how heavy the toll can be in one's journey.

            Yohalem designed a story that examines the minds of players. The game was described as being "self-aware", reacting to players' style 
            of play. Yohalem, in particular, wished to contrast the difference between players and the playable character, in which players have 
            fun playing the game, while Jason is forced on a terrible journey killing people. Being able to freely explore the game world and 
            enjoy the activities it can offer, while ignoring the urgency to save Jason's friends, was meant to reflect players' inner mindset. 
            According to Yohalem, the game can reveal a player's personal perspective, and asks whether players are willing to "kill these 
            characters in the game in order to finish your entertainment". This creates a sense of discomfort to players. Yohalem, when creating 
            the story and the world, was inspired by Pulp Fiction, A History of Violence, Requiem For a Dream and Exit Through The Gift Shop. As 
            opposed to Far Cry 2's oppressive world, the game was inspired by Alice in the Wonderland; Yohalem stated that the game asked why 
            players would willingly trap themselves in a beautifully-crafted but virtual world instead of spending time with real people. 
            The story was widely criticized for racism and colonialism, though Yohalem defended it by calling the game "the opposite of Avatar" 
            as the local indigenous people did not need Jason's help and he was being manipulated into doing what the people wanted. He insisted 
            that players need to approach the game like a riddle so as to understand the subtext and clues that the game offers.

            Assassin's Creed II is an action-adventure game played from a third-person perspective and set in an open world based on late 
            15th-century Renaissance Italy. Gameplay is nonlinear, and focuses on hack and slash combat, stealth, and exploration. The Animus 2.0, 
            a new version of the machine of the same name present in Assassin's Creed, provides in-game context for changes and additions to 
            several game elements. A database is also available, providing extra historical information about key landmarks, characters, and 
            services that the player encounters. The health system has been made more dynamic, with synchronization to the Animus and causing the 
            character to recover only from minor injuries. More grievous injuries require visiting a street-side doctor or use of medicine 
            (which can be purchased from doctors or found on bodies).

            Assassin's Creed II features several new means of transport, such as gondola boats.
        
            The player may now swim in water, and Eagle Vision—the ability to identify specific people and landmarks—can now be used in 
            third-person view and while moving. A young Leonardo da Vinci is present in the game, aiding the player by creating new weapons 
            from translated "Codex pages" that Altaïr, the original game's main character, left behind for future Assassins' analysis and 
            insight. Leonardo's flying machine (based on real-life aeroplanes) can also be used during one mission. Other means of transport 
            available in the game include horses, which can only be ridden outside of the major cities; gondolas, found most prominently in 
            Venice; and a carriage, which is also ridden during a mission involving Leonardo. Each of the places the player can visit is more 
            detailed compared to Assassin's Creed, and NPCs have a more human-like behavior; for example, civilians can sometimes be caught 
            coughing or sneezing. Additionally, the player can hire groups of mercenaries, courtesans, or thieves to fight, distract, or lure 
            guards, respectively. A day and night cycle has been added to the game, giving the game more of a sense of time, in addition to 
            setting missions and events at certain times of the day.

            Batman: Arkham City is an open-world[13] action-adventure game that incorporates tactics from stealth 
            games. It is presented from the third-person perspective, showing the playable character on screen and 
            allowing the camera to be freely rotated around it. The game is set within Arkham City, which is open to 
            the player from the beginning of the game, allowing them to travel freely anywhere within its boundaries. 
            The player can move silently throughout the game, using a combination of gadgets and stealth moves to 
            sneak up on enemies and incapacitate them. Batman can use his cape to glide around the city, diving 
            downwards and swooping upwards to extend his flight, and he can use the grapnel gun's retracting rope to 
            attach to out-of-reach ledges. As Batman, the player is able to use "Detective Vision", a visual mode that 
            highlights elements of interest on-screen, such as character status, collectables, and clues; the mode is 
            also used to perform forensic activities such as tracking the source of a sniper rifle round. 
            The player has access to an in-game criminal database which includes forensic puzzles, as well as a 
            network for hacking communication frequencies.

            Using an improved version of the "Freeflow" combat system from Arkham Asylum, the player can now counter 
            multiple blows simultaneously, catch hurled projectiles, attack aerially, and administer a succession of 
            consecutive strikes. Many of Batman's gadgets can now be used in combat. Enemies are armed with varying 
            levels of armor and weapons; attacks from basic weapons like baseball bats and lead pipes inflict minor 
            damage and can be countered, while guns inflict significant damage. Certain enemies must be disarmed in 
            specific ways before they can be neutralized in combat: enemies with stun batons can only be attacked from 
            behind; enemies with shields require aerial attacks to disarm; and enemies wearing body armor must be stunned 
            with rapid successive strikes before they can be harmed. Larger enemies must be tackled with stuns and combo 
            attacks, and can be manipulated to take out their allies. Disputes between gangs allied to rival villains 
            often spark turf wars, which complicate the player's ability to move about Arkham City. Combat, among other 
            actions, rewards the player with experience points that allow the player to periodically level Batman up and 
            purchase upgrades to his Batsuit, gadgets, and combat and stealth skills. Each category contains 
            approximately 15 different upgrades. For instance, an upgraded grapnel gun can be used to remotely disarm 
            enemies, while a combat upgrade makes it easier to activate special attacks.

            Grand Theft Auto V is an action-adventure game played from either a third-person or first-person 
            perspective. Players complete missions—linear scenarios with set objectives—to progress through the 
            story. Outside of the missions, players may freely roam the open world. Composed of the San Andreas open 
            countryside area, including the fictional Blaine County, and the fictional city of Los Santos, the world 
            is much larger in area than earlier entries in the series. It may be fully explored after the game's 
            beginning without restriction, although story progress unlocks more gameplay content.

            The player character crouched behind a vehicle while in combat. The head-up display elements are visible 
            on-screen.

            Players can take cover behind objects during firefights to avoid taking damage from enemies.

            Players use melee attacks, firearms and explosives to fight enemies, and may run, jump, swim or use 
            vehicles to navigate the world. To accommodate the map's size, the game introduces vehicle types absent 
            in its predecessor Grand Theft Auto IV, such as fixed-wing aircraft. In combat, auto-aim and a cover 
            system may be used as assistance against enemies. Should players take damage, their health meter will 
            gradually regenerate to its halfway point. Players respawn at hospitals when their health depletes. 
            If players commit crimes, law enforcement agencies may respond as indicated by a "wanted" meter in the 
            head-up display (HUD). Stars displayed on the meter indicate the current wanted level (for example, at 
            the maximum five-star level, police helicopters and SWAT teams swarm to lethally dispatch players). 
            Law enforcement officers will search for players who leave the wanted vicinity. The meter enters a 
            cool-down mode and eventually recedes when players are hidden from the officers' line of sight that 
            displays on the mini-map for a period of time.

            Deadpool is an action hack and slash, third-person shooter video game. Gameplay mostly consists of 
            fighting enemies using both melee weapons and guns, with new combos becoming available to Deadpool 
            as he progresses through the story and obtains upgrade points. The game frequently breaks the fourth 
            wall by having Deadpool verbally interact with the player based on their skill and progress.

            By default, Deadpool is armed with both guns and swords, but he also has access to giant hammers, 
            plasma guns, and a range of other weapons. A short range of teleportation moves are possible as well. 
            As he slowly falls apart while sustaining damage, players must avoid further damage in order to 
            recover. The game also features several stealth segments, where Deadpool is able to eliminate enemies 
            silently with either his melee weapons or guns, though gun "stealth" kills will immediately alert 
            all nearby enemies.

            Rise of the Tomb Raider is a third-person action-adventure game in which players control Lara Croft, 
            who is on a quest to discover the legendary city of Kitezh. Combat is a major gameplay mechanic; Lara has 
            a large variety of weapons at her disposal (including assault rifles, shotguns, and pistols), some of 
            which have an alternate firing mode. Players may also utilize stealth to progress through portions of 
            the game, using bows and arrows to take out enemies, creating distractions to draw enemy attention away 
            from Lara, or hiding in bushes to evade enemies. Lara can use the environment to fight enemies, shooting 
            explosive barrels, tearing down rope-wrapped structures with rope arrows, or ambushing enemies from high 
            ground. She can also use her ice axe and combat knife to engage in melee combat with enemies. Completing 
            objectives and side content and eliminating enemies give players experience points (XP). When players 
            collect sufficient XP they level up, receiving a skill point, which can be spent on the game's three 
            skill trees: Brawler, Hunter and Survivor. Brawler enhances Lara's efficiency with weapons, giving her 
            abilities such as retrieving arrows from corpses and a steady aim, as well as boosting her resilience 
            against attack and unlocks new combat skills, such as dodge kill. Hunter gives her an advantage when 
            dealing with the environments and animals. Survivor covers a wide range of skills such as creating 
            incendiary bombs and setting booby traps. Lara learns new languages, enabling her to discover relics 
            (such as coins) which can be traded for new equipment.

            Lara Croft explores one of the game's challenge tombs, which contains an ice ship. The game has 
            semi-open hubs for players to explore. In the hubs are items for Lara to collect, including crafting 
            materials and survival caches. These items and collectibles such as relics and documents can be revealed 
            to players using Survival Instinct, a vision mode which highlights items of interest. By collecting 
            the materials, players can craft items with the game's crafting menu; Lara can craft ammunition, 
            poisoned arrows (using death-cap mushrooms), and Molotov cocktails and hand grenades from cans and 
            bottles. The open areas are filled with wildlife, which can be hunted to collect more resources.

            Red Dead Redemption is a Western-themed action-adventure game played from a third-person perspective. 
            The player controls John Marston and completes missions—linear scenarios with set objectives—to 
            progress through the story; in the game's epilogue, the player controls John's son Jack. Outside of 
            missions, players may freely roam the open world environment, consisting of the American states New 
            Austin and West Elizabeth—fictionalized versions of the Western United States—and the fictional 
            Mexican state of Nuevo Paraíso. Different breeds of horses are the main forms of transportation, 
            each with different attributes. Horses must be tamed in the wild, stolen, or purchased in order to 
            use them. The player can utilize trains and carriages for quick travel. The game's undeveloped land 
            makes up the largest portion of the game world, featuring various rugged and vast landscapes with 
            occasional travelers, bandits, and wildlife. Urban settlements range from isolated farmhouses to 
            crowded towns.

            Red Dead Redemption features a cover system that lets the player hide behind objects and reach out 
            to fire on people and animals. The player can witness and partake in random events as they explore 
            the game world, including public hangings, ambushes, pleas for assistance, encounters with strangers, 
            ride-by shootings, and dangerous animal attacks. Optional side activities are also available, such 
            as dueling, bounty hunting, herb collecting, gambling, and hunting. Red Dead Redemption uses an Honor 
            system, which measures how the player's actions are perceived in terms of morality. Morally positive 
            deeds, such as capturing an outlaw alive or saving a stranger, will add up to the player's Honor. 
            Conversely, negative choices such as murder will subtract from the player's Honor.

            players in-game. On the Windows version of the game, the top left features a chat window when in 
            multiplayer. The mini-map, as well as the main game screen, shows symbols denoting three kinds of 
            entities: blue for allies, green for squadmates, and orange for enemies, this applies to all 
            interactivity on the battlefield. Battlefield 4 options also allow colour-blind players to change the 
            on-screen colour indicators to: tritanomaly, deuteranomaly and protanomaly.

            Weapon customisation is expansive and encouraged. Primary, secondary and melee weapons can all be 
            customised with weapon attachments and camouflage 'skins'. Most weapons can also change between 
            different firing modes (automatic, semi-automatic, and burst fire), allowing the player to adapt 
            to the environment they find themselves in. They can "spot" targets (marking their positions to the 
            player's team) in the single-player campaign (a first in the Battlefield franchise) as well as in 
            multiplayer. The game's bullet-dropping-system has been significantly enhanced, forcing the player 
            to change the way they play medium to long distance combat. In addition, players have more combat 
            capabilities, such as countering melee attacks from the front while standing or crouching, shooting 
            with their sidearm while swimming, and diving underwater to avoid enemy detection. Standard combat 
            abilities are still current including, reloading whilst sprinting, unlimited sprint, prone and 
            vaulting.

            Forza Horizon 4 is a racing video game set in an open world environment based in a fictionalised 
            Great Britain, with regions that include condensed representations of Edinburgh, the Scottish 
            Highlands, the Lake District (including Derwentwater), Ambleside and the Cotswolds (including 
            Broadway), Bamburgh among others. The game features a route creator which enables players to create 
            races using completely customised routes. The game takes place in a synchronised shared world, 
            compared to the AI-driven 'drivatars' from its predecessors, with each server supporting up to 72 
            players. The game is also playable in offline mode.

            The game features a dynamic weather system that also depicts the change of seasons. The environment 
            in the world will change depending on the season: for example, Derwentwater would freeze over in 
            winter and allow players the ability to drive on the ice to reach areas of the game world that would 
            be inaccessible during all the other seasons. The seasons are fixed across the game's servers, 
            meaning that all players will experience the same conditions at the same time. After completing a 
            prologue series of events which introduce players to all four seasons, the shared-world seasons will 
            change every week, with the changes happening on Thursdays at 2:30PM GMT. The season changes are 
            forewarned to players in the game with a countdown clock, which, when finished, will trigger a short 
            cinematic cutscene showing the previous season changing to the new one, although the cinematic will 
            be delayed for players who are in the middle of an event or activity.

            Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2 borrows much of its gameplay from its predecessor. The game allows players to 
            select a team of four given characters from a larger pool of heroes and villains; team members are 
            interchangeable and may be swapped during gameplay. General gameplay mechanics are similar to those of 
            the X-Men Legends series. The game is played from an isometric dungeon crawl perspective, supporting up 
            to four players simultaneously. The Vicarious Visions version on PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, 
            Xbox One and PC consoles of the game also features online play via the PlayStation Network, Xbox Live, 
            and Windows Live/Steam respectively.

            The power system also has been improved, allowing two characters to combine powers, yielding a new 
            attack, known as a "fusion". Each playable character in the game has a unique fusion with every other 
            playable character in the game. An example is Captain America using his shield to reflect Storm's 
            lightning bolts. Players have the ability to level up characters and earn new abilities and powers.
        
            The Vicarious Visions version on PS3, 360, PS4, Xbox One and PC consoles features an updated 
            character progression system, with each character having four core powers that evolve as the 
            character levels up similar to original X-Men Legends. The n-Space version on Nintendo DS, Nintendo 
            Wii, PlayStation 2, and PlayStation Portable consoles of the game resembles the character progression 
            system found in the original Marvel: Ultimate Alliance and original X-Men Legends, except the power 
            set numbers are different, whereas the Nintendo DS version's power set number is limited to 4 powers 
            limited like in the original X-Men Legends. While the Vicarious Visions version have an alternate 
            costume that requires to be unlocked through defeating multiple enemies in specific conditions, 
            n-space version does not feature an alternate costume selection.
